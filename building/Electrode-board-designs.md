# Electrode Board Designs

Here are some examples of open source electrode board designs created at MISL. They are simply named with a version number. In cases where a new design is an iteration of a previous design with very similar features, a minor version number may be appended; for example v4.1 is an iteration of v4.

## MISL v4.1

A fairly generic grid layout, with four reservoirs and a 2x2 heater area, designed for a 50x50mm glass plate. It includes two additional connectors (aside from the main purpledrop connectors) for wiring the resistive heaters and temperature sensors.
